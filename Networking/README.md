# 🌐 Networking: Making connections in the digital world

Networking is the backbone of all systems that communicate over the internet, and understanding it is key to building secure, scalable, and efficient architectures. In this folder, I dive into different aspects of networking, from setting up DNS to configuring cloud networks, and explore how these concepts play into the broader picture of software deployment and system management.

## 🛠️ What I’m Focusing On:
- **DNS and Domain Management**: Setting up custom domains, configuring DNS records, and understanding how domain resolution works.
- **Cloud Networking**: Configuring networking solutions in cloud environments like AWS, GCP, and Azure.
- **Security Best Practices**: Implementing network security protocols, firewalls, and VPNs to secure infrastructure.
- **Troubleshooting Tools**: Using tools like `nslookup`, `dig`, `traceroute`, and `ping` for network diagnostics.
- **Reverse Proxy and Load Balancing**: How to manage traffic flow and distribute it across multiple servers for high availability and performance.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here:
In this section, I document various networking challenges I’ve faced, the solutions I’ve applied, and key lessons I’ve learned along the way. I aim to make this section a resource for understanding and troubleshooting common networking issues, as well as best practices for configuring and securing networks.

Some topics I’ll cover include:
- How to configure DNS to point a custom domain to cloud services.
- How to set up secure network communications with VPNs.
- Exploring network monitoring tools and what they reveal about performance and security.
- Configuring firewalls to limit access and protect services.

## 💡 Why Networking Matters:
Understanding networking is crucial not just for maintaining infrastructure, but for optimising performance, securing systems, and ensuring scalability. The knowledge I’m gaining here is directly applicable to cloud-based systems, containerised applications, and distributed architectures.

As I explore more advanced topics, I plan to focus on:
- **Optimising cloud networking** for better performance and security.
- **Building resilient systems** with redundancy, failover mechanisms, and load balancing.
- **Automating network configurations** for faster, more reliable deployments.

Networking knowledge enables me to design and manage better systems, ensuring they are connected, secure, and scalable. I’m excited to continue growing my skills and understanding of how networks power modern applications.
